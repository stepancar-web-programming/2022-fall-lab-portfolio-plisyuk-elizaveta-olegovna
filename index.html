            <p class="simpletext">Hi, my name is Liza. I'm purposeful, attentive, sociable and hardworking person. I'm
                always ready to self-study and acquire the knowledge necessary for the successful development of my
                skills. In addition to studying at the university, together with friends, I am doing my pet project in
                the field of mobile development.</p>

                <p class="simpletext">As my work, I built business processes for providing gas to residential areas,
                    built the digitalization architecture for repair work on emergency sections of the gas pipeline.</p>
                <li>June-October, 2022: Yandex Toloka, Internship</li>
                <p class="simpletext">I developed the main product of the team - a course about using the platform:
                    together with designers and front-end developers, the design was changed and updated, course
                    materials and projects for students were edited together with methodologists. In addition, I
                    automated and created processes for getting people to the course, sending out information about
                    training, and automating the review of assignments. I also led my own project to create CSA
                    certification, where I started all the processes from scratch and built the architecture of the
                    entire project.</p>
